					<h4>Don't call it a throwback. Twisty Tyrant may be Coaster Coast's oldest and most classic coaster.</h4>
					<p> This coaster still competes with some of the park's heavy hitters. It's one for the ages and has 
						been a family favorite since it opened in 1964. Some roller coaster aficionados may even call 
						it a bucket list coaster. Twisty Tyrant is packed with hills, thrills and history.</p>
					<p>Height Requiremnet: 48" minimum.</p>
					<p>Top Speed: 65 Mph. Total time: 2.05 minutes.</p>

					<h4> This record-breaker's a heartbreaker.</h4>
					<p>	Loopy Log was the first coaster in the world that featured three inversions 
						and it hasn't looked back since. Strap in and brace yourself, 
						because these steel tracks show no mercy. They'll turn you up, down, around, inside out and 
						back again. Gravity has no bounds as you flip upside down and make eye contact with the park goers below.</p>
					<p>Height Requiremnet: 48" minimum.</p>
					<p>Top Speed: 82 Mph. Total time: 2.50 minutes.</p>

					<h4>This windy beast leaves nothing to the imagination.</h4>
					<p>	It gives you everything you love in a coaster and still has you begging for more. 
						Better yet, the Winds of Change will literally leave you hanging over the Coaster Coast's Lagoon. 
						Will you swing across or will you dive in? This coaster leaves you second-guessing as it 
						swings side to side over the park and across the water at adrenaline-inducing speeds. 
						There's nothing you can do but scream and hold on tight.</p>
					<p>Height Requiremnet: 48" minimum.</p>

					<h4>Take the pedal to the metal.</h4>
					<p>	Riders are launched from zero to white knuckles in the blink of an eye on a race track 
						climbing 420 feet in the air. So we aren't kidding when we say that this high-octane 
						sprint to the checkered flag knows a thing or twenty about horsepower.</p>
					<p>Height Requiremnet: Between 52" and 78". </p>
					<p>Top Speed: 95 Mph. Total time: 1.00 minutes.</p>

					<h4>Hold on to your hats. Actually, scratch that. Don't even wear one, because to say you launch out of the station is an injustice.</h4>
					<p>	This coaster catapults you forward so quickly, you're not even sure if there's track in front of you.
						72mph feels more like a hundred. But with a name like Techno Torando, are you really that surprised?
						Strap in, and get ready to stop, drop and roar.</p>
					<p>Height Requiremnet: Between 52" and 78". </p>

					<h4>He who dares to try and conquer Devilish Derby better come prepared to have their plans squandered. </h4>
					<p>	This coaster elevates riders 223 feet up into the skies and then dangles them over the edge for 
						what feels like an eternity before dropping them at a 90-degree angle.If that doesn't show a rider
						who's in charge around here, then the multiple inversions, including a 270-degree roll and a 
						legendary Immelmann maneuver will make it obvious that it's  Devilish Derby who rules the throne.</p>

					<h4>Don't get comfortable. As soon as you're strapped in, the floor drops out. Completely.</h4>
					<p>	After the initial shock, this coaster roars to life as your feet dangle in mid-air. 
						Seagram's escape climbs a staggering first hill, but this is definitely not the time to catch
						your breath because this coaster's nowhere near done yet. The hairpin turns and loops 
						are only surpassed by its remarkable speed.</p>

					<h4>A looming giant amongst a park full of them.</h4>
					<p>	Night Train was designed for the purpose of proving bigger is better. 
						In fact, Night Train's creation demanded an all-new category just to classify
						its one of a kind nature - thus was born the giga-coaster. Ranking as one of the world's best steel coasters, 
						this behemoth shoots riders over hills, past lagoons and through tunnels, all at unthinkable speeds.</p>
					<p>Height Requiremnet: Between 48" and 78". </p>
					<p>Top Speed: 75 Mph. Total time: 2.00 minutes.</p>
